# Climate Change Modeling Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global temperature data from 2000 to 2020 to understand how the Earth's climate is warming.  
Using linear regression, I built a predictive model to estimate future temperature trends.

## Approach
- Collected and cleaned temperature data from 2000‚Äì2020.
- Visualized historical temperature trends with graphs.
- Applied a **Linear Regression** model to forecast future temperatures.

## Key Findings
- The Earth is experiencing a noticeable warming trend.
- My model predicts:
  - **2025**: ~17.0¬∞C
  - **2030**: ~17.5¬∞C

## Why It Matters
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Rising temperatures impact ecosystems, wildlife, and human societies.  
We can all help slow climate change by:
- Planting more trees üå±
- Conserving energy ‚ö°
- Recycling and reducing waste ‚ôªÔ∏è

## Future Work
- Improve the model with additional data sources (CO‚ÇÇ levels, ocean temperatures, etc.).
- Explore more advanced machine learning models like Random Forest or ARIMA.
- Build interactive visualizations for better insights.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-Learn**
