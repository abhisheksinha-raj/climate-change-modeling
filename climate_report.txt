## What I Did
I looked at temperature data from 2000 to 2020 and made a graph to see how the Earth is getting warmer. I used a data science tool called Linear Regression to predict future temperatures.

## What I Found
The Earth is getting hotter! My model predicts:
- In 2025, it might be around 17.0�C.
- In 2030, it might be around 17.5�C.

## Why It Matters
Climate change is warming our planet, which can hurt animals, plants, and people. We can help by planting trees, saving energy, and recycling!
